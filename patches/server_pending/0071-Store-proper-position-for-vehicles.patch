Subject: [PATCH] Store proper position for vehicles

Vehicles could end up saved in a different chunk than their Passenger due to the method that
moves the entities from 1 chunk not being called yet (during tick).

If the passenger is being saved, ensure the vehicle is saved with the same x/z coordinate.
